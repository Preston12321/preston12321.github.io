      <description>A partner and I created this application for our Computer Security and Privacy course as our final project. The goal was to implement a basic password manager that could properly encrypt/decrypt information, as well as provide feedback to the user about the strength of each password. I implemented most of the functionality, including data storage and encryption, as well as the optimized algorithm for checking passwords against pre-existing dictionaries of insecure passwords.</description>
