      <description>A partner and I created this application for our Computer Security and Privacy course as our final project. The goal was to implement a basic password manager that could properly encrypt/decrypt information, as well as provide feedback to the user about the strength of each password. I implemented most of the functionality, including data storage and encryption, as well as the optimized algorithm for checking passwords against pre-existing dictionaries of insecure passwords.</description>

      <description>This project was inspired by the classic Notepad application on Windows. I used this opportunity to learn how to use the Qt framework, but this was also my first native (non-web) project that included a graphical user interface. Previously I had only written code that printed output to the terminal, which is why I chose to copy the design of a pre-existing application rather than create my own design.</description>
