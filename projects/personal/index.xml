      <description>This project has been years in the making&amp;hellip; I first learned chess in middle school, right around the same time that I started visiting my local library in search of programming knowledge (I didn&amp;rsquo;t have internet at home and my school never offered a single CS class until the year after I graduated high school). Because I grew to greatly enjoy playing chess with my friends, I thought it would be really cool to make my own implementation of it.</description>

      <description>This project was inspired by the classic Notepad application on Windows. I used this opportunity to learn how to use the Qt framework, but this was also my first native (non-web) project that included a graphical user interface. Previously I had only written code that printed output to the terminal, which is why I chose to copy the design of a pre-existing application rather than create my own design.</description>

      <title>CPUID</title>

      <description>I started this project after becoming curious how hardware detection tools like CPU-Z work. When I looked up the developers of the software, CPUID, I learned that their namesake was also the name of an Assembly instruction that returns info about a machine&amp;rsquo;s CPU! Since my Computer Systems Organization class taught me about the inner workings of a processor and how Assembly code works, I really wanted to see if I could write my own code to utilize the CPUID instruction.</description>
