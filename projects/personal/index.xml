      <description>This project was inspired by the classic Notepad application on Windows. I used this opportunity to learn how to use the Qt framework, but this was also my first native (non-web) project that included a graphical user interface. Previously I had only written code that printed output to the terminal, which is why I chose to copy the design of a pre-existing application rather than create my own design.</description>

      <description>I started this project after becoming curious how hardware detection tools like CPU-Z work. When I looked up the developers of the software, CPUID, I learned that their namesake was also the name of an Assembly instruction that returns info about a machine&amp;rsquo;s CPU! Since my Computer Systems Organization class taught me about the inner workings of a processor and how Assembly code works, I really wanted to see if I could write my own code to utilize the CPUID instruction.</description>
